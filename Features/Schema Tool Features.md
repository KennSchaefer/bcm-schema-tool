Schema Tool Features:



Initial Experience

* Client login
* Depending on client, List all site URL's in a dropdown via their sitemap.xml file which I can provide per client
* A box to select one of the URLs or type in a different one than from the sitemap.xml file.
* A filter mechanism that auto-filters the list from the sitemap file as you type
* A box to paste in a page of content instead of scraping a URL for content that is yet to launch



After Get Recommendations

* The top 5 recommendations as we have with the options to Generate Schema
* or the client can choose from a comprehensive list of schema types and then Generate that schema instead of one of the recommended types



After Schema Generation

* A "Copy to the Clipboard" option for the client







Notes:

Some schema requires name and address and other entity specific information.  If ChatGPT cannot find that information, we should make sure it is called out to ge "REPLACE WITH CORRECT INFO" within the schema.
